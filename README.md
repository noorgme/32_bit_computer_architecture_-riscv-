Evidence of program execution in [test](/test)

# Achieved:
## Verified completion of the single-cycle non-pipelined CPU in branch [main](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-2/tree/main)

## Pipelined CPU (no hazard detection) in branch [pipelining](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-2/tree/pipelining)

## CPU with memory cache and pipelining (no hazard detection) in branch [Cache](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-2/tree/Cache)

# Group Statement:

We have worked in collaboration over this project to develop a pipelined risc-v processor with cache memory that has been tested & verified to be working on the vbuddy [evidence of pipelining & cache](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-2/WhatsApp Video 2022-12-16 at 18.02.36.mp4)
